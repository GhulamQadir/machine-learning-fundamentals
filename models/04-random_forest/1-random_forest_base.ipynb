Random Sampling of Data (Bootstrapping)\\nEach Decision Tree in the forest is trained on a **random sample of the dataset**.\\n- The sample size is **equal to the total number of rows** in the dataset.\\n- The sampling is done **with replacement**, meaning the same row can appear\\n  more than once in a tree\\'s training data, while some rows might not appear at all.\\n\\nExample:\\nIf the dataset has 100 rows:\\n- Each tree will also get 100 rows, but randomly picked.\\n- Some rows may repeat, and some may be missing.\\n\\nThis technique makes every tree slightly different and helps prevent overfitting.\\n\\nMeaning of \"with replacement\":\\nIt means once a data row is picked for the sample, it is *not removed* from the dataset.\\nSo, it can be chosen again — hence duplicates are allowed.\\n\\n\\n2. Random Sampling of Features (Columns)\\nWhen splitting a node inside a tree, Random Forest does not use all features.\\nInstead, it randomly selects a few features from the total and picks the best split among them.\\n\\nExample:\\n    Total features = [Age, ChestPain, Cholesterol, BloodPressure]\\n    Tree 1 might consider → [Age, Cholesterol]\\n    Tree 2 might consider → [ChestPain, BloodPressure]\\n\\nIn sklearn, this behavior is controlled by:\\n    RandomForestClassifier(max_features=\\'sqrt\\')\\n\\nIf there are 9 total features, each split will randomly consider √9 = 3 features.\\n\\n\\n3. Training Phase (Learning Rules)\\nEach tree uses its own random rows and random feature subsets to learn rules.\\n\\nExample:\\n    Tree 1 learns:\\n        if Age < 42:\\n            if Cholesterol < 210 → predict 0\\n            else → predict 1\\n        else:\\n            if ChestPain == severe → predict 1\\n            else → predict 0\\n\\n\\n4.
