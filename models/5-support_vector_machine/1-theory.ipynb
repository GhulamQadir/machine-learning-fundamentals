    "## **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**\n",
    "- Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for:<br>\n",
    "1. **Classification** (main use)<br>\n",
    "2. **Regression** (less common)<br>\n",
    "- SVM works by finding a decision boundary (hyperplane) that best separates the classes in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The key components of SVM include:\n",
    "1. **Support Vectors**: \n",
    "- Data points that are closest to the decision boundary (hyperplane).\n",
    "- These points define the position of the hyperplane.\n",
    "- Only these points affect the SVM; other points do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hyperplane**:\n",
    "- A line (2D), plane (3D), or general n-dimensional plane that separates the classes.<br>\n",
    "    **Equation:**<br>\n",
    "        𝑤⋅𝑥 + 𝑏 = 0<br>\n",
    "    where, <br>\n",
    "    w = weights, x = features, b = bias.    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Margin**<br>\n",
    "- Distance between the hyperplane and the closest points from each class (support vectors).\n",
    "- SVM’s goal is to maximize this margin for better generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Maximum Margin**<br>\n",
    "- SVM selects the hyperplane with largest possible distance from the nearest data points of each class.\n",
    "- A bigger margin → more confident & robust classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Linear vs Non-linear SVM**<br>\n",
    "- Linear SVM → data can be separated by a straight hyperplane.\n",
    "- Non-linear SVM → uses kernels (RBF, polynomial) to separate data in higher-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Examples:**<br>\n",
    "1. Email Spam Filtering\n",
    "2. Face Recognition\n",
    "3. Medical Diagnosis\n",
    "4. Credit Card Fraud Detection"

    "- Each Feature (or column) = One Dimension\n",
    "- A hyperplane is the boundary that separates data\n",
    "    - in 2D, it's a line\n",
    "    - in 3D, it's a flat plane\n",
    "    - in higher dimensions, it's a hyperplane\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nearest points to the separation line are called support vectors\n",
    "- Support vectors are the closest points from each class to the dividing line\n",
    "- They are the ones that define the position of the boundary.\n",
    "- If we remove SV, the line shifts.\n",
    "- If we remove others, the line barely changes\n",
    "- If new data appears near the margin, model has low confidence in it. \n",
    "- If the new data appears far from the margin, the model is highly confident."
