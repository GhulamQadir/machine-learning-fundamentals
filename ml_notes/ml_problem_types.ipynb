    "#### Can we predict someone has heart disease based on their health measurements?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Binary Classification\n",
    "- Predict one of two possible categories\n",
    "- Output: 0 or 1, Yes/No, True/False  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Predict whether a patient has heart disease (1 = Disease, 0 = No Disease)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Multi-Class Classification\n",
    "- Predict one of more than two categories  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- What type of animal is this? (Cat, Dog, Horse, Cow, Goat)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Regression\n",
    "- Predict a continuous numerical value  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Predict the selling price of a house\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4. Multi-Label Classification\n",
    "- Predict multiple binary labels for each instance  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Predict which genres apply to a movie (Action, Comedy, Thriller, Drama)\n",
