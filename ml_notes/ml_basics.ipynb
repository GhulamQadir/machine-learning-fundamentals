    "# **Machine Learning Basics**\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "Machine Learning is when we teach a computer to learn from examples instead of giving it step-by-step rules.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:  \n",
    "If you want a computer to recognize cats in pictures, instead of writing exact rules like ‚Äúif it has whiskers, 4 legs, pointy ears‚Ä¶ then cat‚Äù, you just show the computer thousands of pictures of cats and not-cats.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The computer looks at patterns in those examples (shapes, colors, textures) and then learns how to guess whether a new picture has a cat.  \n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ **In short:**  \n",
    "**Machine learning = computers learning from data and improving with experience, just like humans do.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intelligence vs Programming\n",
    "- Humans can take decisions as per the situation due to intelligence.  \n",
    "- If something out of routine happens, you must be able to take decisions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule-Based Paradigm (Traditional Programming)\n",
    "- You give the computer exact rules (e.g., `2 + 2 = 4`).  \n",
    "- The computer always follows those rules.  \n",
    "- It **cannot learn anything new** unless you add new rules yourself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Calculator  \n",
    "- ‚Äúif-else‚Äù program  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**  \n",
    "`Data ‚Üí Rules ‚Üí Result`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning Paradigm\n",
    "- You **don‚Äôt write rules**.  \n",
    "- Instead, you give the computer a lot of **examples (data)**.  \n",
    "- The computer finds **patterns** and makes its own rules internally (mathematical models).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "Show thousands of cat pictures ‚Üí computer figures out patterns ‚Üí now it can guess if a new picture is a cat.  \n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ ML adapts and improves as it gets more data.  \n",

    "## **Types of Machine Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Supervised Learning (Learn with a teacher)\n",
    "- Computer is given **examples with answers** (input + correct output).  \n",
    "- Learns to map **input ‚Üí output**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Show pictures labeled ‚Äúcat‚Äù or ‚Äúdog‚Äù.  \n",
    "- Computer learns the difference.  \n",
    "- Later, for a new picture, it predicts cat or dog.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Used in:** Spam detection, face recognition, price prediction  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Unsupervised Learning (Learn without a teacher)\n",
    "- Computer is given only **data, no answers**.  \n",
    "- It tries to find **patterns or groups** on its own.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Shopping data ‚Üí computer discovers ‚Äúpeople who buy chips also buy cold drinks‚Äù.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Used in:** Customer segmentation, clustering news, anomaly detection  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Reinforcement Learning (Learn by trial and error)\n",
    "- Computer learns by **doing actions** and receiving **rewards/punishments**.  \n",
    "- Tries to maximize rewards over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Robot learns to walk (+points when moves correctly, ‚Äìpoints when falls).  \n",
    "- Video game AIs improve score by trial and error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Used in:** Robotics, self-driving cars, game AI  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Summary\n",
    "- **Supervised** ‚Üí learn from labeled examples (with answers).  \n",
    "- **Unsupervised** ‚Üí find hidden patterns (without answers).  \n",
    "- **Reinforcement** ‚Üí learn by trial & error with rewards.  \n",

    "### Regression\n",
    "- Used when predicting **numerical values**.  \n",
    "- Output = continuous value (numbers).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:** Predict price, weight, temperature, sales, salary, age, CGPA  \n",

    "### Classification\n",
    "- Used when predicting **categories (labels)**.  \n",
    "- Output = discrete categories.  \n",

    "1. Training Set: Used to train the model\n",
    "2. Testing Set: Used to evaluate final model performance\n",
    "3. Validation Set : (optional) Used for tuning models (hyperparameters)"
